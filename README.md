## Demo

## Features
This project aims to launch a collective and interactive digital fireworks display at the closing ceremony. People can tap the screen to launch fireworks, and by creating and joining servers, they can share augmented reality fireworks content. Using HoloKit hardware enhances the immersion and beauty of the fireworks display. There are three types of fireworks available: standard fireworks, conference logo fireworks, and custom text content fireworks.
